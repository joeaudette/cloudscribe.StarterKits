# Using SimpleContent with cloudscribe Core and NoDb 

[SimpleContent](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.SimpleContent) is a simple, yet flexible content and blog engine for ASP.NET Core.

This sample uses [cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) for user authentication and [NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) file system storage for content and data. 

[cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) is a multi-tenant web application foundation. It provides multi-tenant identity management for sites, users, and roles.

[NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) is a "No Database" file system storage, it is also a "NoSql" storage system.

This sample is pre-populated with sample data. There are 2 pre-configured sites, the root level site and another folder site at /two

When you run it you can login to either site with admin@admin.com as the username and admin as the password.

Be sure to update the credentials before deployment.
